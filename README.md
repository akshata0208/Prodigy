TASK 1
Ceaser Cipher 
This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting the characters in the message. The program is designed to be user-friendly, with prompts guiding the user through the encryption and decryption process.

Features
Encryption and Decryption: The program can both encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift value.
User Input: Users can enter their own message and choose the shift value for the cipher.

Usage
Run the Program: Execute the script to start the Caesar Cipher program.
Select Action: Choose 'e' for encryption or 'd' for decryption.
Enter Message: Input the message you wish to process.
Specify Shift: Enter the shift value for the Caesar Cipher.
View Result: The program displays the encrypted or decrypted message.

TASK 2
Image Encryption Tool
This Python program implements a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. The program can encrypt and decrypt images by performing basic mathematical operations on the pixel values. It is designed to be user-friendly, guiding users through the encryption and decryption processes with clear prompts.

Features
Image Encryption: Users can encrypt an image by applying a mathematical operation to each pixel value, effectively altering the image.
Image Decryption: The program can reverse the encryption process to restore the original image.
User Input: Users can specify the image file and the encryption key.
File Handling: The program saves the encrypted and decrypted images to specified file paths.

How It Works
Encrypt Image: Multiplies each pixel value by a key and then divides by the key plus one to create the encrypted image.
Decrypt Image: Reverses the encryption process by multiplying each pixel value by the key plus one and then dividing by the key.
Usage

Run the Program: Execute the script to start the Image Encryption program.
Select Action: Choose 'e' for encryption, 'd' for decryption, or 'q' to quit.
Encrypt Image:
Enter the encryption key.
Specify the location or URL of the image to be encrypted.
Decrypt Image:
Enter the decryption key.
Specify the location of the encrypted image.

View Results: The program saves and indicates the location of the encrypted and decrypted images.

TASK 3
This Python program implements a basic keylogger that records and logs keystrokes. It captures the keys pressed by the user and saves them to a log file, providing an educational tool for understanding how keylogging works. This program includes ethical considerations and requires user consent before running.

Features
Key Logging: Records and logs every keystroke along with a timestamp.
Log File: Saves the logged keystrokes to a specified file.
User Consent: Includes a disclaimer and requires user acceptance of terms and conditions.
Duration Control: Allows the user to specify the duration for which the keystrokes should be logged.

Usage
Run the Program: Execute the script to start the keylogger program.
Read and Accept Disclaimer: Carefully read the disclaimer and accept the terms and conditions to proceed.
Specify Duration: Enter the duration in seconds for which the keylogger should run.
Logging Keystrokes: The program will capture and log keystrokes during the specified period.
Review Log: After the duration ends, the log file containing the keystrokes will be saved and its location displayed.
